# Open Data Services Codelist Schema

A schema for documenting codelists in CSV format.

This page presents the schema as a table. You can also [download it as JSON Schema](../schema/codelist-schema.json).

```{tip}
To reference the codelist schema, use its canonical URI:

[`http://codelist-schema.opendataservices.coop/1__0__0/codelist-schema.json`](http://codelist-schema.opendataservices.coop/1__0__0/codelist-schema.json)
```

```{jsonschema} ../schema/codelist-schema.json
:pointer: /$defs/Row
```

## Appreciation

The codelist schema is based on the codelist schema developed by the [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) for the [Open Contracting Data Standard](https://standard.open-contracting.org/).
